# Semantic-content-recommendation-system-with-Amazon-SageMaker
Built a semantic, content recommendation system that combines topic modeling and nearest neighbor techniques for information retrieval using Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms for Neural Topic Model (NTM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN).



## Overview
"Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, or searching for metadata that describe data. This lab combines the techniques of topic modeling and nearest neighbor for information retrieval. This approach uses topic modeling to generate semantic distribution vectors representing the meaning of documents by topics, and then uses the nearest neighbor technique to index topic vectors to retrieve similar documents for a given input document based on topic similarity. By using Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms, you do not need to label data and the information retrieval is based on semantic meaning similarity instead of simple string matching."
